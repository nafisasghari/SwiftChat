This project has been done in 3 weeks at [Insight data science fellows program](https://insightfellows.com/data-science). This project is a consulting project for a startup company. The company that I partnered with offers a Conversational Marketing service to e-commerce companies to connect with their customers on behalf of these brands with a live person when they need assistance. However, agents more than 80% of the time respond by using pre-defined templates. The goal of this project is to build and compare different classification models to predict the suitable "Template" for incoming messages that can be answered by templates.
