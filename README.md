# SwiftChat

This project has been done in 3 weeks at [Insight data scince]:(https://insightfellows.com/data-science) fellows program. This is a consulting project and the company that I partnered with offers a Conversational Marketing service to e-commerce companies to connect with thier customers on behalf of these brands with a live person when they need assistance. However, agents more that 80% of the times respond by using pre-defined templates. The goal of this project is building and comparing different classification models to predict the suitable "Template" for incoming messages that can be answered by templates.
